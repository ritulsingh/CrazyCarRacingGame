# CrazyCarRacingGame

For this project our group(Me, Shashidhar or Rajesh) would like to implement a Crazy Car Racing Game based on HTML. 
We tried to implement this game based on basic html5 and JavaScript and the objective of this 
game is to survive as far as you can in order to achieve the highest score.
In the growing field of Web based development and even more rapidly growing sector of 
1game development we created this web based crazy car racing game in order to entertain the 
customers in such a way that they play this game until they win it or beat the highest score, 
due to which the stresses or boredom of customers will be vanished and they can concentrate 
on their official life well.
